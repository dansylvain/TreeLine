   # Example for future implementation:
   import structlog
   
   logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)
   
   async def chat(request: ChatRequest, db: AsyncSession):
       correlation_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
       logger.info("Processing chat request", 
                  correlation_id=correlation_id,
                  session_id=request.session_id)
   ```

2. **Input Validation Enhancement**
   ```python

       @validator('message')
       def validate_message(cls, v):
           if len(v.strip()) > 5000:  # Prevent extremely long messages
               raise ValueError('Message too long')
