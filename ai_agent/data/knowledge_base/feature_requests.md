## 📝 What Makes a Good Request?

Here’s what helps us prioritize your suggestion:
- Solves a recurring problem for multiple users
- Aligns with TreeLine’s product vision
- Feasible with current platform infrastructure
- Improves usability or reduces friction

If you're unsure whether something exists, check the [Help Center](https://help.treeline.com) or ask our support team before submitting.

## ✅ What Happens After You Submit

Once we receive your request:
1. Our product team reviews it and tags it by category (UI, Integrations, etc.)
2. If accepted, it’s added to the internal roadmap
3. We may reach out for additional info or invite you to early testing

You can track the status of major requests at [treeline.com/roadmap](https://www.treeline.com/roadmap) (coming soon).
